Syntax Highlighting
===================

Document scanner
----------------

To generate Lexer Scanner jflex 1.61 was used.
The flex files are in tools folder.
Still, after using the existing jflex software and the skeleton to generate the java lexer files it will require some final touches for it to work.

> jflex 1.61 can be found on https://sourceforge.net/projects/jflex/
